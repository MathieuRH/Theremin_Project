# Theremin project
This python project uses python and a leap motion to simulate a theremin.
## First part
This branch contains the first part of our project, where we worked on two separate applications.
### Simulating a theremin sound
The files interface_synthesis.py and theremin_sound.py, writtten in python3, will allow you to simulate a theremin controlled by your computer mouse.
### Interfacing python2, python3 and the leap motion
The files theremin.py (python2) and audio.py (python3) will allow you to connect a python2 script to the leap motion and to connect a python2 script with a python3 script using a socket connection.
## Second part
To see those two apps merged into a single one, with even more features, go to the branch [main_refactored](https://github.com/MathieuRH/Theremin_Project/tree/main_refactored).
